        I think he did it but I just can't prove it
        I think he did it but I just can't prove it
        I think he did it but I just can't prove it
        No, no body, no crime
        But I ain't letting up until the day I die
        No, no
        I think he did it
        No, no
        He did it
        I think he did it but I just can't prove it
        Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
        And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
        Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me ("She was with me dude")
        Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy
        They think she did it but they just can't prove it
        They think she did it but they just can't prove it
        She thinks I did it but she just can't prove it
        No, no body, no crime
